To test the experience of a new user:
1. `pip install -e python/frontend/cirrus`
2. `cirrus_setup`
3. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/logistic_regression.ipynb. The cell that
    prints the error task's output should show increasing accuracy.
4. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb. The
    I=0, I=1, and so on.

To test the full process for building, publishing, and running:
1. `pip install -e python/frontend/cirrus`
2. `cirrus_setup --instance-resources-only`
3. Use the AWS console to create an S3 bucket named "cirrus-public-<yourname>".
    Open the bucket, and in the "Permissions" tab, open the "Public access
    settings" section. Disable "Block new public ACLs and uploading public
    objects (Recommended)" and "Remove public access granted through public ACLs
    (Recommended)".
4. Change PUBLISHED_BUILD in /python/frontend/cirrus/cirrus/setup.py to
    "s3://cirrus-public-<yourname>".
5. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/build.ipynb.
6. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/publish.ipynb.
7. `cirrus_setup`
8. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/logistic_regression.ipynb. The cell that
    prints the error task's output should show increasing accuracy.
9. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb. The
    cell that prints the error task's output should show increasing accuracy for
    I=0, I=1, and so on.
